# Basic-Search-Engine
A search engine written in C++. Can match a user-entered query with results existing in the Database and return it's relevance.
The idea behind this all is trying to make a kernel of a search system, which in the future can be extended and "most likely" sold to Google for enormous amount of money.
However, if anybody of my 0 contributors can implement a relevance-based sort of results(top-1 priority), that would be pretty cool. Also I'll apreciate people adding more stop words (line 118).
